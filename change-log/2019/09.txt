**New formatting for the footnotes :** the numbering uses squared braces now.


**References of things to know:** a ¨python file containing only a list variable with the references of theorems, propositions, ... that must be known by the students (this will be used to produce automatically a short version of a lesson). This external file has a name looking like path::``*-allrefs.py``.


**New package loaded:** the package `tagging` allows to activate, or not, pieces of ¨latex code (this will be used to produce short version of the lessons).
