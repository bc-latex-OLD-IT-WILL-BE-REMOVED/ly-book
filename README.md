About this package
==================

**ly-book** has been built to formate lesson of math and computer science in high school.


Only one french documentation is proposed but it contains a lot of examples of use : see the PDF file named `lybook-doc[fr].pdf` inside the folder `lybook`.

The only thing needed to use is the standalone package ``lybook.sty`` inside the folder `lybook`.



I beg your pardon for my english...
===================================

English is not my native language, so be nice if you notice misunderstandings, misspellings or grammatical errors in my documents and my codes.



Changes in this version `0.0.0-beta`
